### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

fang71 could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official fang71 docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/gunhe/fang71/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.

  are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `fang71` for local development.

1. Fork the `fang71` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/fang71.git
    ```

3. Ensure [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is installed.
4. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv:

    ```
    $ poetry install -E test -E doc -E dev
    ```

5. Create a branch for local development:

    ```
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the
   tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox:

    ```
    $ poetry run tox
    ```

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. Check
   https://github.com/gunhe/fang71/actions
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Tips

```
$ poetry run pytest tests/test_fang71.py
```

To run a subset of tests.


## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in CHANGELOG.md).
Then run:

```
$ poetry run bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags
```

GitHub Actions will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
